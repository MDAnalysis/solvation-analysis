Explore the precise solvation shell of every solute.

Speciation tabulates the unique solvation shell compositions, their fraction,
and their temporal locations.

From this, it provides search functionality to query for specific solvation shell
compositions. Extremely convenient for visualization.

While ``speciation`` can be used in isolation, it is meant to be used
as an attribute of the Solute class. This makes instantiating it and calculating the
solvation data a non-issue.

class Speciation:
    """
    Calculate the solvation shells of every solute.

    Speciation organizes the solvation data by the type of residue
    coordinated with the central solvent. It collects this information in a
    pandas.DataFrame indexed by the frame and solute number. Each column is
    one of the solvents in the solvent_name column of the solvation data. The
    column value is how many residue of that type are in the solvation shell.

    Speciation provides the speciation of each solute in the speciation
    attribute, it also calculates the fraction of each unique
    shell and makes it available in the speciation_fraction attribute.

    Additionally, there are methods for finding solvation shells of
    interest and computing how common certain shell configurations are.

    Parameters
    ----------
    solvation_data : pandas.DataFrame
        The solvation data frame output by Solute.
    n_frames : int

        Calculate the fraction of shells matching shell_dict.

        This function computes the fraction of solvation shells that exist with a particular
        composition. The composition is specified by the shell_dict. The fraction
        will be of all shells that match that specification.

        Attributes
        ----------
        shell_dict : dict of {str: int}
            a specification for a shell composition. Keys are residue names (str)
            and values are the number of desired residues. e.g. if shell_dict =
            {'mol1': 4} then the function will return the fraction of shells
            that have 4 mol1. Note that this may include shells with 4 mol1 and
            any number of other solvents. To specify a shell with 4 mol1 and nothing
