Study the topology and structure of solute-solvent networks.

Networking yields a complete description of coordinated solute-solvent networks
in the solution, regardless of identify. This could include cation-anion networks
or hydrogen bond networks.

While ``networking`` can be used in isolation, it is meant to be used
as an attribute of the Solution class. This makes instantiating it and calculating the
solvation data a non-issue.

class Networking:
    """
    Calculate the number and size of solute-solvent networks.

    A network is defined as a bipartite graph of solutes and solvents, where edges
    are defined by coordination in the solvation_data DataFrame. A single solvent
    or multiple solvents can be selected, but coordination between solvents will
    not be included, only coordination between solutes and solvents.

    Networking uses the solvation_data to construct an adjacency matrix and then
    extracts the connected subgraphs within it. These connected subgraphs are stored
    in a DataFrame in Networking.network_df.

    Several other representations of the networking data are included in the attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    solvents : str or list[str]
        the solvents to include in the solute-solvent network.
    solvation_data : pandas.DataFrame
        a dataframe of solvation data with columns "frame", SOLVATED_ATOM, "atom_ix",
        "dist", resname, and "res_ix".
    solute_res_ix : np.ndarray
        the residue indices of the solutes in solvation_data
    res_name_map : pd.Series
        a mapping between residue indices and the solute & solvent names in a Solution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    network_df : pd.DataFrame
        the dataframe containing all networking data. the indices are the frame and
        network index, respectively. the columns are the res_name and res_ix.
    network_sizes : pd.DataFrame
        a dataframe of network sizes. the index is the frame. the column headers
        are network sizes, or the number of solutes + solvents in the network, so
        the columns might be [2, 3, 4, ...]. the values in each column are the
        number of networks with that size in each frame.
    solute_status : dict of {str: float}
        a dictionary where the keys are the "status" of the solute and the values
        are the fraction of solute with that status, averaged over all frames.
        "alone" means that the solute not coordinated with any of the networking
        solvents, network size is 1.
        "paired" means the solute and is coordinated with a single networking
        solvent and that solvent is not coordinated to any other solutes, network
        size is 2.
        "networked" means that the solute is coordinated to more than one solvent
        or its solvent is coordinated to more than one solute, network size >= 3.
    solute_status_by_frame : pd.DataFrame
        as described above, except organized into a dataframe where each
        row is a unique frame and the columns are "alone", "paired", and "networked".

    Examples
    --------
     .. code-block:: python

        # first define Li, BN, and FEC AtomGroups
        >>> solution = Solution(Li, {'BN': BN, 'FEC': FEC, 'PF6': PF6})

        ----------

        solvents : str or list of str
