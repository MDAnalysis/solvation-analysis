Analysis library defines a variety of classes that analyze different aspects of solvation.
These classes are all instantiated with the solvation_data (pandas.DataFrame) generated
from the Solution class.

While the classes in analysis_library can be used in isolation, they are meant to be used
as attributes of the Solution class. This makes instantiating them and calculating the
solvation data a non-issue.

class Speciation:
    """
    Calculate the solvation shells of every solute.

    Speciation organizes the solvation data by the type of residue
    coordinated with the central solvent. It collects this information in a
    pandas.DataFrame indexed by the frame and solute number. Each column is
    one of the solvents in the res_name column of the solvation data. The
    column value is how many residue of that type are in the solvation shell.

    Speciation provides the speciation of each solute in the speciation
    attribute, it also calculates the percentage of each unique
    shell and makes it available in the speciation_percent attribute.

    Additionally, there are methods for finding solvation shells of
    interest and computing how common certain shell configurations are.

    Parameters
    ----------
    solvation_data : pandas.DataFrame
        The solvation data frame output by Solution.
    n_frames : int
        The number of frames in solvation_data.
    n_solutes : int
        The number of solutes in solvation_data.

    Attributes
    ----------
    speciation : pandas.DataFrame
        a dataframe containing the speciation of every li ion at
        every trajectory frame. Indexed by frame and solute numbers.
        Columns are the solvent molecules and values are the number
        of solvent in the shell.
    speciation_percent : pandas.DataFrame
        the percentage of shells of each type. Columns are the solvent
        molecules and and values are the number of solvent in the shell.
        The final column is the percentage of total shell of that
        particular composition.

        This function computes the percent of solvation shells that exist with a particular
        composition. The composition is specified by the shell_dict. The percent
        will be of all shells that match that specification.

        Attributes
        ----------
        shell_dict : dict of {str: int}
            a specification for a shell composition. Keys are residue names (str)
            and values are the number of desired residues. e.g. if shell_dict =
            {'mol1': 4} then the function will return the percentage of shells
