Getting Started
===============

Solvation analysis makes it easy to rapidly analyze coordination, species-species pairing,
and speciation. While solvation analysis is designed with molecular (and especially ionic)
systems in mind, it's methods should be extensible to any system where a solute is
dissolved in solvents.

Get started with solvation_analysis by working through the basics_tutorial.ipynb
Jupyter notebook which can be found in the tutorials section of the
`GitHub <https://github.com/MDAnalysis/solvation-analysis>`_. The tutorial
introduces the basic functionality and usage of the solvation_analysis package.
