Welcome to SolvationAnalysis's documentation!
=========================================================

Solvation analysis implements a `robust, cohesive, and fast set of methods
<https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6227159028334592>`_ for
analyzing the solvation structure of a liquid. It seamlessly integrates with
`MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/>`_, making use of the core AtomGroup
and Universe data structures to parse solvation information. If you are interested
in understanding the solvation structure of a liquid, this package is for you!

To get started, check out the Getting Started section of the documentation.
